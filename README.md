# Original (v1.0) ver of Torque and Drag Model
3D Soft String Model with no vibrational effect

### Features:
* Tripping operations can be simulated (RIH, POOH)
* No pipe rotational effect
* No Torque calculation
* Viscous force due to circulation is accounted
* Inertial Forces are accounted

## Main Changes:
* Input data has information for 'RESTR'
* The pressure loss calculation function is old (stepwise)
* Hole depth cannot be different from bit depth (On-bottom)
