# Original (v1.0) ver of Torque and Drag Model
3D Soft String Model with no vibrational effect

### Features:
* Tripping operations can be simulated (RIH, POOH)
* No pipe rotational effect
* Includes Torque calculation
* Viscous force due to circulation is accounted
* Inertial Forces are accounted

## Main Changes:
* Completely changed the Input data
* Added new plot functions to easily plot the forces
* Removed unnecessary files
* Added .gitignore
* Fluid forces need to be verified
* Added new Run.py file
* The pressure loss calculation function is old (stepwise)
* Hole depth cannot be different from bit depth (On-bottom)
